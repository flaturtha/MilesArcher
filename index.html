            <p>Lets face it, you're busy. The job requires long hours. Your family wants to spend time with you. You've got meetings, appointments, time wasted standing in line waiting. And waiting.</p>
            <p>Obligations.</p>
            <p>Responsibilities.</p>
            <p>There's precious little time left in a day for what you want to do. For reading a good story that lets you escape to a world of excitement, danger, intrigue.</p>
            <p>But what if you could? What if you could escape and lose yourself in a good murder mystery? Its simple, just carry a paperback novel with you and read a page or two when time allows.</p>
            <p>Yeah, but how do I keep up with the flow of the story if I just read a page or two?</p>
            <p>I hear you. Its hard to dip in and out of a good story when you've only got 5 minutes here, or 20 minutes there.</p>
            <p>And that's why I've created <strong>Tales of Murder</strong>, a device-agnostic website that provides the best murder mystery short stories available anywhere!</p>
