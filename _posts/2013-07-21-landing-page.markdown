## Do you:
* look longingly at your bookshelf full of murder mysteries, _wishing you had the time to read_?
* cruise the used bookstore or yard sales, _but keep on driving because there's just no time_?
* waste time waiting &hellip; for another meeting &hellip; kids to get out of practive &hellip; a delayed appointment, _when you could be reading_?

Lets face it, you're busy. The job requires long hours. Your family wants to spend time with you. You've got meetings, appointments, time wasted standing in line waiting. And waiting.

Obligations.

Responsibilities.

There's precious little time left in a day for what you want to do. For reading a good story that lets you escape to a world of excitement, danger, intrigue.

But what if you could? What if you could escape and lose yourself in a good murder mystery? Its simple, just carry a paperback novel with you and read a page or two when time allows.

>Yeah, but how do I keep up with the flow of the story if I just read a page or two?

I hear you. Its hard to dip in and out of a good story when you've only got 5 minutes here, or 20 minutes there.

And that's why I've created **Tales of Murder**, a device-agnostic website that provides the best murder mystery short stories available anywhere!

## Tales of Murder
