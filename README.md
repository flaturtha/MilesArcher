# Tales of Murder 
## [Prelaunch] - MilesArcher, v.01 (alpha)

### TalesofMurder.com
A device-agnostic murder mystery short story site featuring 1,500+ word short stories and serialized novels, covering the gambit of murder mystery genres from cozies to noir. If you're a fan of murder mystery short stories and have a web-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, web-enabled TV/game console), you can enjoy the best murder mysteries available anywhere on the web ... no app required and fully formatted for any device.

### MilesArcher
The MilesArcher, aka v.01 or alpha, version of the site is the prelaunch landing page site designed to introduce potential fans to what TalesofMurder.com will offer when launch in mid-October 2013. Interested fans can read about the site's offerings and, if interested, click through to learn more about the prelaunch email signup offer. If still interested, they can sign up by entering their email address on the offer page.

MilesArcher is a simple, Jekyl-based site based on the layout and design structure of the [Jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com) site. It mimics, as much as possible, the overall structure of the Jekyll home site including folder layout and HTML structure. The layout of the site (in terms of its wireframe) meets the needs of the MilesArcher site and following [Tom Preston-Werner's](http://tom.preston-werner.com) method of developing a Jekyll site. After all, why mimic others when you can mimic the man who created Jekyll in the first place?

#### Pages
MilesArcher is a simple site set up with two primary pages:
1. landing page (TalesofMurder.com)
2. offer page (TalesofMurder.com/prelaunch_offer/)

Two secondary pages, only accessible to those who've signed up via email, are:
1. short story archive page - a blog-type reverse-chron list of the latest short stories with teasers, post artwork and a link to the story post, itself
2. short story post page - a mockup, alpha version (meaning it will be under development and subject to change as the main site is developed for production) of the single posts/short story page.

Additionally, it will have several other post-type entries to serve various functions:
1. post-signup pop-up - once fans enter their email address &amp; click Submit, they'll see a pop-up modal window (likely borrowed from Zurb's Foundation 4) that thanks them and tells them to watch for a double opt-in email.
2. double opt-in email - the email signup system will automatically send the fan a double opt-in email with a unique link that they must click to verify subscription.
3. goodies page - once they click the verification URL in the email, they'll be taken to this page, which lists any downloads they'll get and details about logging in to see new stories, etc.
4. enewsletter archive page - this page will archive enewsletter issues so fans can always find back issues. It may be the same page as the short story archive page.
5. TBD - other pages as development warrants
