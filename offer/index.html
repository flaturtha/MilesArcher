      <h2>Limited Time Offer!</h2>
      <p>When the countdown timer, above, reaches ZERO, this offer comes off the table for the simple reason that this offer is only valid until the full <strong>TalesofMurder.com</strong> site launches on October 15, 2013.</p>
      <p>After that, site membership will be opened up to the general public and the opportunity to be part of the special <em>prelaunch</em> offer will be gone.</p>
      <h3>So why join now?</h3>
      <p>Anyone who joins prior to the site's public launch will enjoy a variety of special priviledges not offered to non-Charter Members. Simply, no one who joines <strong>TalesofMurder.com</strong> after October 15 will be able to be a Charter Member.</p>
      <h3>So what?</h3>
      <p>So Charter Members will always enjoy special designation on the site, including an avatar badge that demonstrates that they are <em>true murder mystery fans!</em></p>
      <p>Additionally, Charter Members enjoy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>this great thing</li>
        <li>another great thing</li>
        <li>that other surprisingly cool thing</li>
        <li>another cool offer</li>
        <li>last, and biggest offer</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Now, I know what you're probably thinking &hellip;</h3>
      <blockquote>
      <p>I've got plenty of time to join. I'll do it later.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Let me just say, "Yeah, right!" When was the last time you remembered to do that <em>thing</em> later? Remember, you're busy. You've got obligations, committments. And signing up takes just a couple seconds. Type in your first and last names, your email address and click the big red button. Simple.</p>
      <p>Go on. Do it now. I dare you!</p>
